RecollFs - FUSE filesystem using Recoll index, showing filtered files in directories.

Installation:
Just place the recollfs file in the path and make it executable (e.g. in /usr/local/sbin or /usr/local/bin).

Prerequisities:
- Python 2
- Recoll: you should have a recoll index available. Standard location is: ~/.recoll.
  It is possible to build the index with command line only utility: recollindex.
  In Debian you need recoll and python-recoll packages.
- FUSE: python-fuse package.
- Maybe more is needed, just check the imports at the beginning of the program.

Usage:

Mounting of the filesystem
  - directly from shell:
    recollfs -o index=~/.recoll ~/mysearches

  - using fstab:
    #recollfs  <mountpoint>  fuse  rw,allow_other,index=<index direcory>  0 0
    recollfs  /mnt/search  fuse  rw,allow_other,index=/home/.recoll  0 0

Searching
  - just make a directory with a name which is a query, e.g:
    mkdir ~/mysearches/"nice flowers"
  - all the files matching the query will be symlinked inside this directory
